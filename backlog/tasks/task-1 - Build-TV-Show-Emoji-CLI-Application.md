## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a command-line application that generates emoji representations of TV shows based on specific aspects (plot, style, culture, actors, etc.) using local LLMs via Ollama. The tool should provide an intuitive interactive experience with autocomplete, colored output, and comprehensive error handling. Built with TypeScript/Bun and compiled to single executables for Mac, Linux, and Windows.
